# Seach-with-Synonyms
Here is how it works:
It takes user input, tokenize it (if it contains more than one word), puts it and its individual words, along with it synonyms (from WordNet) and the synonyms of its individual words in a list, then, searches for items in that list in the "word.txt" file (a file containing a list of English words, to be replaced with a database), then prints the output (all words in the gathered list that are found on the file/database)
